# Dog Breed App
A convolutional neural network algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. In this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

## Further Explanation
This notebook is the second project form the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. It's also the first exercise where a convolutional neural network is introduced. The main focus is to train the network to distinguish different breeds of dogs.
